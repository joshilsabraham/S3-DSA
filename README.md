| 📄 File Name               | 🔍 Description                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `double_ended_queue.c`     | Implements a deque allowing insertion and deletion from both ends  |
| `linear_queue.c`           | Demonstrates basic queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, and display |
| `poly.c`                   | Adds two polynomials using singly linked lists                     |
| `sparse_matrix_addition.c` | Adds two sparse matrices and displays the result in triplet form   |

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This lab is designed to help students:

* Understand the logic and implementation of fundamental data structures
* Translate theoretical DSA concepts into working C programs
* Apply linked lists, queues, stacks, and matrix representations
* Strengthen algorithmic thinking and pointer manipulation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language**: C
* **IDE/Tools**: VS Code, Code::Blocks, or any C-compatible compiler (GCC, MinGW)
